Passage:

In the early 20th century, bicycles were seen as a symbol of freedom and a means of transportation for the masses. They were a cheaper and more accessible alternative to horses and carriages, and their popularity skyrocketed as manufacturers began producing them in large quantities.

Bicycles became a symbol of empowerment for women, who were finally able to travel independently without relying on male chaperones. They were also embraced by the working class, who used them to commute to and from work. The popularity of bicycles was so great that entire cities were redesigned to accommodate them.

However, the rise of the automobile industry in the mid-20th century led to a decline in the use of bicycles for transportation. Cars were faster, more comfortable, and more convenient, and their use quickly became the norm. In many places, cycling was seen as a leisure activity rather than a practical means of transportation.

Recently, however, there has been a renewed interest in cycling as a means of transportation. Bicycles are seen as a solution to many problems facing modern cities, including traffic congestion, air pollution, and a lack of physical activity. Cycling is also a relatively inexpensive and environmentally friendly alternative to cars.
