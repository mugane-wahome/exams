                TutorLisa`s  mission is to provide free, high-quality educational
                resources, thus breaking down the barriers that often restrict
                students from accessing essential learning materials. While the
                current focus is on GED exams, this platform is dedicated to assisting
                you on your learning journey by giving you the tools needed to
                succeed.

                Please note our tests will not truly measure how well you will do in
                the exam, they are only here to serve as a refreshers and validators
                of your studies.

                    A Personal Struggle Turned Mission
                </h3>
                <p class="content">
                    this site  was born from a personal struggle to find excellent,
                    cost-free practice tests. Studying for the GED exams, I realized the
                    challenge wasn't just in the learning but also in finding the right
                    resources to validate that learning. While paid platforms were
                    available, they remained inaccessible to many including myself, due to their costs. It was this
                    struggle that gave me the idea.
                </p>
                <!-- <p class="content">
                    As a self-taught coder, free code camp was indispensable in helping me learn this amazing craft.It
                    taught me not only the value of knowledge but also the power of accessibility. Drawing from this
                    experience, I decided to create this platform, where anyone with interest can come to hone their
                    knowledge without being hindered by economic constraints, because I believe education is the best
                    tool to foster a better tomorrow.

                    A New Apporach to an Old Problem
                </h3>
                <p class="content">
                    Creating quality practice tests usually needs a lot of time and people. At Prep & Learn, we use AI,
                    specifically GPT-4, to create tests in a matter of minutes. Then, either I or an instructor gives
                    them agit
                    review to make sure they're up to standard.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    GPT-4 also allow us to easily provide reasoning behind the answers, giving us a ready made template
                    to
                    include any additional information we want to include. Which can be perfect for creating bite-sized
                    study notes, to remind students on essential concepts and terms.
                </p>
                <!-- <p class="content">
                    One of the best parts of using GPT-4 is that it doesn’t just give
                    answers—it also explains why those answers are correct. This is a
                    real game-changer, especially for tests like RLA where understanding
                    why an answer is right can sometimes be tricky. 
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    Additionally, these
                    explanations also serve as handy, bite-sized study notes, helping
                    students remember important info. So with Prep & Learn, you're not just testing yourself,
                    you're learning something new every time you take a test!

                <p class="content">
                    This approach, though effective, comes with certain limitations, the biggest being that
                    GPT-4 sometimes messes up on knowledge-based questions because of its training data limits.
                    Additionally
                    while our generated tests are excellent
                    revising what you've learned, they are not truly representative of the real exams.
                    This is why we want to team up with educational institutions, blending their expertise with our
                    AI-generated content to make our tests feel as real as possible, even if they're not a perfect
                    match.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    Of course the current biggest limitation is that I am the only one doing everything for this
                    platform. So if you wish to contribute to this please let me know.
                </p>
                <!-- <p class="content">
                    That's where partnerships with educational institutions come into
                    play. With their understanding of how exam questions
                    work,combined with AI-created contents, we can more closely emulate the real exam, even though it
                    still won't be a perfect replica.
