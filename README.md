ChatGPT seems to be unable to generate diverse Biology questions, thus resulting in lots of repeated questions with even the exact same wording.

## Inspiring Potential, Encouraging Dreams: Your Portal to Free Learning

Hi, and thanks for stopping by! This repository houses a project that I hold close to my heart. As a student who has recently returned to the education path via a GED prep school, I found a scarcity of free resources for subjects like Reasoning Through Language Arts (RLA) and Social Studies. This struggle has motivated me to develop this app, which aims to provide a free, comprehensive quiz platform for GED exam preparation.

## You can test it [here](https://prep-learn.vercel.app/)

## üìù Latest Update

31/08/2023 : The mobile version is really helping people get onboard, I was even asked to work on the school education platform. I gonna focus on trying to get auth to work with firebase. Gonna see how it goes from there.

30/08/2023 : Fixed The crashing bug, also finished up the mobile version.

23/08/2023 : Still a bit sick and have exams for this whole week, also I'm focusing on learning firebase for now so everything gonna be on hold for a while

Looking into Firebase to serve as an actual backend for the app.

About 40% done on the new method of creating tests (question creation logic pretty much done)

Currently Known Bugs : None

Urgent Goal: Polish up the tablet version too.

Goal for a spare time: add the option to type the section and questions by hand. (Might try it to make it tomorrow after school)

Quiz mode is done along with the summary screen, while timed quizzes still remain, I think I gonna take a break from this app for now, the whole thing is pretty much ready and built. Bugs have been tested and fixed. While some design leave me unsatisfied it majority of the time they look great. I gonna focus on learning a bit more and finishing my GED exams, I might come back to this app to add new tests for myself and friends but that's probably it for now. I look forward to gaining enough skills to craft a login and user system by which I would consider the app to be fully ready and done.

Good luck to anyone that stumbles on my app. The source code as it stands is free to use just give me credit. I might take this whole thing private when I implement the member system for commercial and security reasons, but the code as it stands right now will remain on this repo, I will only take the further codes private.

## üïñ Current Planned Timeline

Please note these times are the worst possible times, In reality I hope to have everything production ready by mid July

- [x] Launch of the app with just the functions to choose quizzes and answer them (June 20th 2023) Progress : 100% DONE
- [x] New method to save answers (July 20th 2023) Done
- [ ] Timed Quizzes (July 25th 2023) Progress : Might prioritize Quiz Mode Over this

- [ ] Switch to MongoDB for data storage (N/A) Not sure if I wanna switch to Database yet.
- [ ] Login with Google (N/A) Not sure if I want to go this route, instead focusing on making the base functions a lot better and more user friendly
- [ ] Login with other providers (N/A)
- [ ] Crash Courses (N/A) Focus switched to diversifying question types.
- [ ] User roles (N/A) Unsure
- [ ] Classes (N/A)

## üåç Why This Matters

This project is particularly dedicated to my peers in Myanmar, who often face difficulties with these subjects due to language barriers and lack of resources. I hope that this quiz app can become an invaluable tool to aid their learning and success.

## üí° The Idea

The Prep&Learn will start by reading from a file and subsequently from a database to generate practice exams. The user will interact with these exams by selecting answers from multiple choices. The ultimate goal is to create a free, accessible resource for GED students everywhere to enhance their studies.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Roadmap

The development of this app will follow a roadmap divided into three categories:

### üéØ Main Features

These are the essential components of the app, and they must be bug-free before the app can be considered ready for launch.

1. Convert text input into a set of questions and answers swiftly.
2. Present the questions to the user for answering.
3. Provide a score to the user upon submission of the exam.
4. Store your unsubmitted data inside local storage to persist through refresh and accidental closing of the tab.

### üéà Add-on Features

These features would be great additions to the app if feasible.

1. User Account system with score tracking.
2. Allow users to upload un-vetted exams to the database, which can be confirmed by me to be displayed on the website.
3. Separate quizzes not only based on subjects but also on individual topics like Government and Civics.
4. Timed quizzes.
5. Crash Courses on the topics
6. Making the app display x^2 as x with a small 2 on top and other math related quirks.

### üåà Dream Features

These features would be awesome to have, but they might be challenging to implement due to their complexity.

1. User roles for teachers and students, and even class grouping. This feature would enable schools to use the app to assign practice work and homework.
2. Identifying the user's weaknesses and suggesting quizzes to improve on those.
3. Provide Burmese translation for words on hover or click

## ü§ù Let's Collaborate

I invite like-minded individuals passionate about education to collaborate on this project. Together, we can create an invaluable resource to empower students and help them succeed in their GED journey.
