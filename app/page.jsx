                        A Personal Struggle Turned Mission
                    </h3>
                    <p className="content">
                        Prep & Learn was born from a personal struggle to find excellent,
                        cost-free practice tests. Studying for the GED exams, I realized the
                        challenge wasn&apos;t just in the learning but also in finding the right
                        resources to validate that learning. While paid platforms were
                        available, they remained inaccessible to many in developing
                        countries, including myself, due to their costs. It was this
                        struggle that gave birth to the idea of Prep & Learn.

                    <p className="content">
                        Creating quality practice tests usually needs a lot of time and people. At Prep & Learn, we use AI,
                        specifically GPT-4, to create tests in a matter of minutes. Then, either I or an instructor gives
                        them agit
                        review to make sure they&apos;re up to standard.
                    </p>
                    <p className="content">
                        GPT-4 also allow us to easily provide reasoning behind the answers, giving us a ready made template
                        to
                        include any additional information we want to include. Which can be perfect for creating bite-sized
                        study notes, to remind students on essential concepts and terms.

                    <p className="content">
                        This approach, though effective, comes with certain limitations, the biggest being that
                        GPT-4 sometimes messes up on knowledge-based questions because of its training data limits.
                        Additionally
                        while our generated tests are excellent
                        revising what you&apos;ve learned, they are not truly representative of the real exams.
                        This is why we want to team up with educational institutions, blending their expertise with our
                        AI-generated content to make our tests feel as real as possible, even if they&apos;re not a perfect
                        match.

                    <p className="content">
                        Of course the current biggest limitation is that I am the only one doing everything for this
